                <h1>Ronaldinho</h1>
                <p>Ronaldo de Assis Moreira (born 21 March 1980), commonly known as Ronaldinho Gaúcho or simply Ronaldinho, is a Brazilian former professional footballer and ambassador for Barcelona. He played mostly as an attacking midfielder, but was also deployed as a forward or a winger. He played most of his career at European clubs Paris Saint-Germain, Barcelona and A.C. Milan as well as playing for the Brazilian national team. Often considered one of the best players of his generation and regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time, Ronaldinho won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d'Or. He was renowned for his technical skills and creativity; due to his agility, pace and dribbling ability, as well as his use of tricks, feints, overhead kicks, no-look passes and accuracy from free-kicks.</p>
                <p>Ronaldinho made his debut for Grêmio, in 1998. At age 20, he moved to Paris Saint-Germain before signing for Barcelona in 2003. In his second season with Barcelona, he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award. The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was in Barcelona winning the UEFA Champions League, their first in fourteen years, as well as another La Liga title, giving him his first career double. After scoring two spectacular solo goals in El Clásico, Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player, after Diego Maradona, to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu. Ronaldinho also received his second FIFA World Player of the Year award, as well as the Ballon d'Or.</p>
